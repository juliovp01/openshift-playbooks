== Application Logs

=== Accessing Container Logs

Because we use Kubernetes as the container orchestrator for OpenShift, the collection of and access to container logs is actually much simpler than most would think. This is because Kubernetes captures all stdout and stderr from every container and writes it to files on the node as json data within the container's data directory (i.e. `/var/lib/docker/<container-id>/<container-id>-json.log`). Kubernetes then creates a symbolic link to that logfile in /var/log/containers/, the name of which contains metadata about the continer such as namespace, container and pod ids. For example:

----
synthetic-logger-0.25lps-pod_default_synth-lgr-997599971ee6366d4a5920d25b79286ad45ff37a74494f262e3bc98d909d0a7b.log
->
/var/lib/docker/containers/997599971ee6366d4a5920d25b79286ad45ff37a74494f262e3bc98d909d0a7b/997599971ee6366d4a5920d25b79286ad45ff37a74494f262e3bc98d909d0a7b-json.log
----

Awesome! No agents or container customization needed. We just have our application use a stdout/stderr logger (i.e. Console Logger in JBoss) and Kubernetes takes care of the rest.

=== Log Aggregation

Since we already have the container logs available on the Node's file system, we can concentrate on doing something useful with them.

==== Simple Aggregation with Syslog Forwarders

If we just need to collect the raw data, then the centralization process is very simple. We can just point syslog at the directory containing log files and have it forward data on to a link:http://www.itzgeek.com/how-tos/linux/centos-how-tos/setup-syslog-server-on-centos-7-rhel-7.html[central logging server].

Need some examples of forwarding OpenShift logs using rsyslog.

==== Centralizing Logs with Fluentd

The OpenShift 3.0 Documentation provides a way to link:{docs_url}install_config/aggregate_logging.html[use Fluentd to capture and centralize container logs]. This implementation is fairly limiting though as it doesn't fully parse the log files and capture metadata like namespaces, pods names, etc.

==== Full Metadata Supported Log Aggregation with Fluentd

If we want to collect application metadata so that we can do things like filter logging views based on the application or project, we need to install some additional Fluentd plugins to make our aggregation agent more Kubernetes and Docker aware. Unfortunately this is more complicated at the moment (with OSE 3.0) because Red Hat does not ship fluentd or any of its plugins, so there are no RPMs or installation channels to facilitate installation in an Enterprise Environment.

Here is a guide that walks through installation of fluentd and required plugins using as RubyGems.

=== OpenShift API Event Logging Through HAProxy

Because all user-attributable events occur through the OpenShift Master API service, we may run into a situation with which each is required to be logged. In a typical multi-master OpenShift setup, each master provides its own API service. This would mean 3 separate API servers to log. Luckily, the front-end proxy server provides a single point of API event aggregation to each of the masters. In this procedure, HAProxy will be configured to provide this level of centralized logging.

By default, OpenShift does not provide logging of events to its API service. Out of the box, HAProxy is configured for TLS passthrough of connections, relying on a simple TCP load balancing of all traffic on port 8443. Normally you would be able to configure HAProxy to HTTP mode and insert a simple httplog statement. This will not work with OpenShift, since it uses SSL certificates for internal communication. This procedures also assumes the OpenShift installation to be in a PKI-enabled environment in which the masters each have their own PKI certificate.

First of all, we need to modify the haproxy config file found in /etc/haproxy/haproxy.conf.

----

In the file above, there are a few things to notice first. First of all, the main front-end block listening on port 8443. That doesn't change. What happens inside that block is a little more interesting. OpenShift provides a public URL for external API, and private URL for internal API interactions. These are defined in master-config.yaml. What we need to do here is SSL terminate the public API, while leaving the internal API as TLS pass-through. We can use SNI declarations in HAProxy to route this traffic based on the URL. Traffic tagged as external is routed to a special HAProxy front-end configured as a "feed-back loop" that listens on a special port 9003 to provide SSL terminiation and TLS pass-through respectively. SNI configuration is based on a procedure at http://serverfault.com/questions/662662/haproxy-with-sni-and-different-ssl-settings

In this configuration, the OpenShift public master certificates will be presented by the HAProxy, instead of all the masters. If you have any named certificates specified on your masters, you can remove them, because the the public client will no longer care. The private traffic is then re-encrypted to the masters using the OpenShift master CA found in /etc/origin/master/ca.pem.
You may create a seperate encryption certificate pair using:

----
# oadm ca create-signer-cert \
  --cert='/etc/openshift/master/haproxyca.crt' \
  --key='/etc/openshift/master/haproxyca.key' \
  --name='openshift-haproxy-signer@1432232228' \
  --serial='/etc/openshift/master/haproxyca.serial.txt'

# oadm create-api-client-config \
  --certificate-authority='/etc/openshift/master/HAproxySigner.crt' \
  --client-dir='/etc/openshift/master/haproxy' \
  --signer-cert='/etc/openshift/master/haproxyca.crt' \
  --signer-key='/etc/openshift/master/haproxy.key' \
  --signer-serial='/etc/openshift/master/haproxy.serial.txt' \
  --user='system:haproxy'
----

If not already set, add the http_listen context to that port.

----
# semanage port -a -t http_port -p tcp 9003
----

We need the SSL termination to be able to inspect the master traffic, so we copy the master.server.pem and master.server.key from /etc/origin/master/ on the OCP master nodes.
The backends have also been split to address the SSL termination. Notice the private and public backend, specifically that the public specifies CAs for each of the master servers. This CA should be configured with the same enterprise CA that you used when installing the masters.

Notice the HAProxy logging configuration under the global section.

----
log     127.0.0.1 local1
----

HAProxy uses rsyslog sockets to forward its logging facilities directly. This means all your haproxy events will appear on the local Rsyslog server under facility "local1". You can then configure rsyslog to output these logs to file if you wish in /etc/rsyslog.conf.

----
module(load="imudp")
input(type="imudp" port="514" address="127.0.0.1")
...
local1.*      -/var/log/haproxy.log
...
----

After making these changes to HAProxy, restart the service and you should start seeing your master API logging.
